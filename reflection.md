- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I overloaded goUp()and goDown()in both the house and library classes to allow you to go up/down more than one floor at a time (if there was an elevator for the house class). Distinct from the goToFloor() method you don't specify the floor you want to go to, but how many floors up/down you want to go. For the cafe class I overloaded the constructor so that you can easily make a cafe with an empty inventory, and so you can make a cafe that has more than just coffee ingredients and cups. (namely pizza slices). My advice is to read the directions closely! I had a bit of trouble working out what was expected until I read the rubric. But once I did that I understood I needed to overload two for EACH subclass and make the elevator work in the house only if it had an elevator, and everything else went well. Adding buildings to the campus map was especially straightforward.
