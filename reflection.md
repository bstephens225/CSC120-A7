- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I overloaded goUp()and goDown()in both the house and library classes to allow you to go up/down more than one floor at a time (if there was an elevator for the house class). zdistinctfrom the goToFloor() method you don't specify the floor you want to go to, but how many floors up/down you want to go. For the cafe class I overloaded the constructor so that you can easily make a cafe with an empty inventory, and so you can make a cafe that has more than just coffee ingredients and cups. (namely pizza slices).
